[Consul](https://www.consul.io/) makes it simple for services to register themselves and to discover other services via a DNS or HTTP interface. Register external services such as SaaS providers as well. Pairing service discovery with health checking prevents routing requests to unhealthy hosts and enables services to easily provide circuit breakers. Consul scales to multiple datacenters out of the box with no complicated configuration. Look up services in other datacenters, or keep the request local.
